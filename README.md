# CharlotteOS - charlottek

`charlottek` is an operating system kernel developed as a key component of the CharlotteOS project but it is designed to be flexible enough that we hope it can also find use in many other places. It seeks to be a monolithic kernel with low-level system call interfaces that borrows ideas from exokernels and other novel systems like Plan 9 and Fuchsia. Its design allows for almost any higher level interface to be layered on top and also includes a typesafe system namespace (akin to the namespaces found in Fuschsia and Plan 9 but more flexible and typesafe) with URIs as paths which has the added benefit of allowing access to the namespace of another host over a network without having to mount anything locally all while being secured by granular capabilities and a persistent mandatory access control policy.

charlottek is still in early development, and core subsystems are actively being built. We welcome contributionsâ€”feel free to grab an issue from the tracker, suggest features, or participate in discussions on our repository, Discord server or Matrix instance.

## Programming Languages

- `charlottek` is written in Rust and ISA specific assembly languages
- x86_64 assembly should use Intel syntax as implemented by `rustc` and `llvm-mc` exclusively

## External Dependencies

- C language dependencies are allowed if vetted by maintainers.
- Any dependencies in languages other than Rust, C, and assembly are strictly forbidden.
- Always prefer a high-quality Rust equivalent over an external C library unless there is good
  reason to do otherwise
