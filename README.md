# CharlotteOS Limine Rust Barebones

This repository serves as a template for developing a Limine Boot Protocol compliant operating system kernel in the Rust Programming Langauge.

The following need to be installed in order to use it:

- Rustup
- A Rust toolchain
- xorriso
- curl
- make
- qemu-system

With all of those dependencies installed all of the make commands should just work. If not then open an issue.
