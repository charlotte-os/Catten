//! # Inter-Processor Interrupts (IPIs) on the x86_64 Architecture
//!
//! The Catten IPI protocol is designed to work using remote procedure calls (RPCs).
//! This allows for a flexible and extensible way to send IPIs between processors.
//! The protocol supports both unicast (single target) and multicast (multiple targets) IPIs.
//! The implementation is kept as similar as possible across different architectures within reason.
//!
//! Each logical processor (LP) has its own IPI mailbox, which holds a pointer to the the requested
//! RPC and its arguments. To send an IPI create the RPC type instance and attempt to write its
//! address into each target LP's mailbox but only if it is currenlty null using an atomic
//! compare-and-swap (CAS) operation. If you fail to write even one of the the target LPs'
//! mailboxes, revert the ones you did write back to null. When writing to multiple mailboxes you
//! MUST do so in order of ascending LP ID to avoid deadlocks. If you are able to write to all
//! target mailboxes, then immediately send an IPI interrupt to each target LP to trigger the IPI
//! ISR and have your RPC be executed. At the end of the IPI ISR the target LP MUST set its
//! mailbox back to null to indicate it is ready to receive another IPI.
